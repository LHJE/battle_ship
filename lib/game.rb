# things we need:
# turns
# way to input Coordinates
#
#
# 1) press play, instantly see the board.
# 2) player places ships
# 3) computer places ships
# 4) game determines who goes first
# 5) player (either before or after computer) inputs first shot fired coord.
# 6) play continues [UNTIL LOOP] until one player's ships are sunk
# 7) Announces winner
# 8) Would you like to play again?
#
#
# instantiate an object and run that.  Rewrite runner
